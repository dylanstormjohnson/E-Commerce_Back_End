## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js, MySQL.  I was motivated to build this project to showcase the backend coding for an e-commerce database and connecting to it.  It was built because e-commerce is a common usage for databases and product information storage.  It is intended to solve the problem of being unable to see and manipulate the database associated with said application.  In making said project, I learned about routing with express, Sequelize, and calling routes with Insomnia.
